Market Problem
•	Sales currently depends on sales operations to generate consistent, directional pricing for clients
•	Sales does not understand the digital streaming features, functions and technology well
•	Sales is not confident enough to ask probative questions that elicit the relevant information to generate directional pricing
•	Sales relies too much on product team to generate directional pricing
•	Current traditional broadcast clients are not aware of the fact that we also stream channels and could easily stream their linear channel at low cost
We need a tool that allows clients and sales the flexibility to define the parameters of their channel(s) for streaming and receive a directional price estimate along with a sample stream output and way to contact sales to complete the order.
